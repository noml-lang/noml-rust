<!-- 0.4.0 - Major refactor
============================================ -->
## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added
- **HTTP Includes Support**: Added `include "https://..."` for remote configuration loading with async resolver
- **Extended Native Types**: Added `@ip()`, `@semver()`, `@base64()`, and `@uuid()` native type converters
- **Schema Validation System**: Complete type-safe configuration validation with builder pattern and detailed error reporting
- **Async Configuration API**: Added `parse_async()`, `parse_from_file_async()`, and async config management methods
- **HTTP Content Caching**: Built-in caching for HTTP includes to improve performance and reduce network requests
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks**: Performance benchmarks for small, medium, and large configurations (19Î¼s to 1.7ms)
- **Extended Test Coverage**: Async functionality tests and schema validation test suite
- **Configuration Management Demo**: Added example showing programmatic config modification workflow

### Enhanced  
- **Performance Optimizations**: Zero-copy lexer improvements and optimized release profile
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages for HTTP includes, schema validation, and type conversion failures
- **Code Quality**: Complete Clippy lint cleanup achieving zero warnings across all targets and features
- **Documentation**: Updated README with schema validation examples and async usage patterns
- **Build Configuration**: Added async_demo and format_preservation_demo examples to Cargo.toml

### Fixed
- **Float Comparisons**: Replaced exact equality comparisons with epsilon-based assertions for test reliability
- **Clippy Warnings**: Fixed 24+ warnings including format strings, pattern matching, recursion parameters, and type complexity
- **Boolean Assertions**: Replaced `assert_eq!` with literal booleans to direct `assert!()` calls
- **Doc Comment Spacing**: Fixed empty line issues after documentation comments
- **Compilation Issues**: Fixed missing fields in ResolverConfig when async feature is enabled
- **Type Safety**: Improved AST to Value conversion with better error handling
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed orphaned `grammar_test_completion.rs` file with incomplete tests

### Technical Improvements
- **Async Architecture**: Non-recursive HTTP include resolution to avoid async recursion limitations
- **Memory Management**: Improved caching and resource management for HTTP requests
- **API Consistency**: Unified sync and async APIs with consistent error handling patterns

### Security
- **Environment Variable Handling**: Improved secure handling of environment variables with defaults
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation for native types and function arguments

### Performance
- **Parser Optimizations**: Improved parsing performance with better token handling
- **Memory Management**: Reduced unnecessary allocations and improved zero-copy operations

### Breaking Changes
- None in this release - all changes are backward compatible

### Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
- **Usage Examples**: Real-world examples for web applications, microservices, and cloud deployments
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for effective NOML usage in production systems
- **Integration Guide**: Instructions for AI systems and automated tools

### Testing
- **Integration Tests**: 20+ comprehensive test cases covering all major functionality
- **Error Handling Tests**: Validation of error conditions and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for parsing and resolution operations
- **Example Validation**: All examples are tested and validated

### Developer Experience
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages with context and suggestions
- **IDE Support**: Improved syntax highlighting and error detection capabilities
- **CLI Improvements**: Enhanced command-line tool functionality and output formatting
- **AI Coding Agent Instructions**: Added comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for AI coding assistants with detailed architecture documentation, development patterns, and best practices

### Fixed (Current Session)
- **Critical Resolver Bug**: Fixed table handling in `src/resolver.rs` where dotted keys like `[database.pool]` were being stored as flat keys instead of nested structures, causing test failures
- **Doc Test Compilation**: Fixed compilation errors in `src/config/mod.rs` doc tests by correcting Option/Result usage patterns (replaced `?` operator with `unwrap()` for Option types)
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: 
  - Added `chrono` serde features to `Cargo.toml` for proper DateTime serialization on Windows
  - Fixed DateTime pattern matching in `src/resolver.rs` (line 567) and `src/main.rs` (line 116) with proper `#[cfg(feature = "chrono")]` guards
  - Verified compilation success on Windows MSVC and Linux GNU targets
- **Test Suite Stability**: All 86 tests now pass consistently, including 53 unit tests, 2 main tests, 16 integration tests, and 15 doc tests

### Enhanced (Current Session)
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Verified and enhanced compatibility across macOS, Windows (MSVC), and Linux (GNU) with proper path handling using `std::path` APIs
- **DateTime Feature Handling**: Improved conditional compilation for optional chrono features to prevent compilation failures on platforms without datetime support
- **Test Coverage Validation**: Comprehensive test suite verification ensuring all core functionality works across platforms
- **Async Support**: Added comprehensive async functionality with optional "async" feature flag
  - New async parsing functions: `parse_async()`, `parse_from_file_async()`, `parse_raw_from_file_async()`
  - Async Config methods: `Config::load_async()`, `Config::save_async()`, `Config::reload_async()`
  - Async file operations using `tokio::fs` for non-blocking I/O
  - Full thread safety with `Send + Sync` implementations verified
  - Comprehensive async test suite with 8 tests covering all async functionality
  - Modern Rust ecosystem compatibility for web frameworks and cloud services
  - Optional dependencies: `tokio` (async runtime) and `reqwest` (HTTP client for future remote includes)
  - Backward compatibility: All existing sync APIs remain unchanged
- **Thread Safety**: Verified and tested `Send + Sync` implementations for all core types (`Value`, `Config`, `NativeResolver`)
- **Test Suite Expansion**: Total test count increased to 96 tests (55 unit + 2 main + 16 integration + 15 doc + 8 async tests)
- **Development Dependencies**: Added tokio test macros and async runtime for comprehensive async testing
