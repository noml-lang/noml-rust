## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it **privately and responsibly**.

üìß **Contact:** [ <a href="mailto:report@jamesgober.dev?subject=Security%20Vulnerability">report@jamesgober.dev</a> ]

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- The version or commit affected
- Your suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

Do **not** disclose security issues in GitHub issues, pull requests, public forums, or other visible channels.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process. When you report a valid security issue:

- We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**
- We will investigate and respond with next steps
- You will be credited (with permission) if the issue is confirmed and resolved

Critical issues may result in priority patches, embargoes, or mitigations. We appreciate your discretion.

## Updates & Timeline

Security fixes are prioritized based on severity, exploitability, and impact. Minor issues may be resolved during regular maintenance cycles, while critical ones will be addressed immediately.

<br>
