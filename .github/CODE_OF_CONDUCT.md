    <h1 align="center">CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>
    <p>
        These community guidelines are essential for respectful collaboration and maintaining a focused, productive, and no-nonsense environment. While we value honesty and personality, this space must remain professional, inclusive, and free from unnecessary drama or hostility. We‚Äôre here to build ‚Äî let‚Äôs make it count.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<h2>1. Purpose:</h2>
<p>
    This Code of Conduct exists to keep the project clean, productive, and focused on code ‚Äî not chaos.
</p>
<b>
    We don‚Äôt care who you are, what you believe, or how you identify. We care that:
</b>
<ul>
    <li>You write solid code.</li>
    <li>You collaborate without being a dick.</li>
    <li>You don‚Äôt derail the project with drama, flamewars, or personal baggage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You don't have to agree with everyone here. You just have to <b>respect the boundaries of this space.</b>
</p>

<br>
<h2>2. Expectations:</h2>
<b>
    All contributors, maintainers, users, and observers are expected to:
</b>
<ul>
    <li>Act professionally ‚Äî even when joking around.</li>
    <li>Keep personal issues, politics, and crusades <b>out</b> of project discussions.</li>
    <li>Offer feedback constructively. ‚Äú<i>This sucks</i>‚Äù isn‚Äôt helpful. ‚Äú<i>Here‚Äôs why this might be better</i>‚Äù is.</li>
    <li>Respect project maintainers‚Äô decisions ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt agree.</li>
    <li>Accept that dark humor, sarcasm, or bluntness <b>may exist</b>, but <b>harassment will not be tolerated</b>.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<br>
<h2>3. Absolutely Not Tolerated:</h2>
<b>We have a zero-tolerance policy for:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Targeted harassment, stalking, or doxxing.</i>
    <li>Trolling, flamebait, or instigating fights in issues/PRs.</li>
    <li>Spam, self-promotion, or attention-seeking nonsense.</li>
    <li>Personal threats, legal threats, or hostile takeovers.</li>
    <li>Sexualized content, weird kinks, or political manifestos.</li>
    <li>Weaponized victimhood ‚Äî don‚Äôt bait or cry bully for attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you're more focused on ‚Äú<i>being offended</i>‚Äù than ‚Äú<i>building something</i>,‚Äù you‚Äôre in the wrong place. 
</p>


<br>
<h2>4. Mutual Respect and Identity Boundaries:</h2>
<p>
    This project welcomes developers of all races, genders, and backgrounds ‚Äî and we ask that you respect the boundaries of others.
</p>
<b>We do not enforce ideological alignment or personal affirmation, but we do expect:</b>
<ul>
    <li>No personal harassment based on identity, lifestyle, background, or beliefs.</li>
    <li>No drama or derailment over unrelated identity politics.</li>
    <li>No expectation that others conform to your personal views.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We‚Äôre here to collaborate, not convert each other.
    <br>
    Professionalism doesn‚Äôt require agreement ‚Äî just mutual respect and shared focus.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    If you encounter behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the project team privately:

<h2 align="center">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<br>
<h2 id="humor-guidelines">Humor Guidelines</h2>
<p>
    We have a sense of humor around here ‚Äî sometimes dark, sometimes dry, sometimes dumb. Humor is part of personality, and we don‚Äôt want a sterile codebase.
</p>
<b>That said, your jokes aren‚Äôt a license to:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Demean others.</li>
    <li>Bait someone into an argument.</li>
    <li>Drown out a discussion that actually matters.</li>
    <li>Hide toxicity behind ‚Äú<em>it‚Äôs just a joke</em>‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Know your audience ‚Äî if you‚Äôre not sure, keep it in the chill zone (Discord, off-topic channels, etc.). Humor is welcome here ‚Äî but you‚Äôre not a stand-up comic, and this isn‚Äôt open mic night.
</p>


<br>
