    <h1 align="center">CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>
    <p>
        These community guidelines are essential for respectful collaboration and maintaining a focused, productive, and no-nonsense environment. While we value honesty and personality, this space must remain professional, inclusive, and free from unnecessary drama or hostility. We’re here to build — let’s make it count.
    </p>
</div>

<br>

<h2>1. Purpose:</h2>
<p>
    This Code of Conduct exists to keep the project clean, productive, and focused on code — not chaos.
</p>
<b>
    We don’t care who you are, what you believe, or how you identify. We care that:
</b>
<ul>
    <li>You write solid code.</li>
    <li>You collaborate without being a dick.</li>
    <li>You don’t derail the project with drama, flamewars, or personal baggage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You don't have to agree with everyone here. You just have to <b>respect the boundaries of this space.</b>
</p>

<br>
<h2>2. Expectations:</h2>
<b>
    All contributors, maintainers, users, and observers are expected to:
</b>
<ul>
    <li>Act professionally — even when joking around.</li>
    <li>Keep personal issues, politics, and crusades <b>out</b> of project discussions.</li>
    <li>Offer feedback constructively. “<i>This sucks</i>” isn’t helpful. “<i>Here’s why this might be better</i>” is.</li>
    <li>Respect project maintainers’ decisions — even if you don’t agree.</li>
    <li>Accept that dark humor, sarcasm, or bluntness <b>may exist</b>, but <b>harassment will not be tolerated</b>.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>3. Absolutely Not Tolerated:</h2>
<b>We have a zero-tolerance policy for:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Targeted harassment, stalking, or doxxing.</i>
    <li>Trolling, flamebait, or instigating fights in issues/PRs.</li>
    <li>Spam, self-promotion, or attention-seeking nonsense.</li>
    <li>Personal threats, legal threats, or hostile takeovers.</li>
    <li>Sexualized content, weird kinks, or political manifestos.</li>
    <li>Weaponized victimhood — don’t bait or cry bully for attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you're more focused on “<i>being offended</i>” than “<i>building something</i>,” you’re in the wrong place. 
</p>


<br>
<h2>4. Mutual Respect and Identity Boundaries:</h2>
<p>
    This project welcomes developers of all races, genders, and backgrounds — and we ask that you respect the boundaries of others.
</p>
<b>We do not enforce ideological alignment or personal affirmation, but we do expect:</b>
<ul>
    <li>No personal harassment based on identity, lifestyle, background, or beliefs.</li>
    <li>No drama or derailment over unrelated identity politics.</li>
    <li>No expectation that others conform to your personal views.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We’re here to collaborate, not convert each other.
    <br>
    Professionalism doesn’t require agreement — just mutual respect and shared focus.
</p>

<br>
<h2>5. Reporting Violations:</h2>
<p>
    If you encounter behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the project team privately: 
    <br>
    [ <a href="mailto:report@jamesgober.dev?subject=Conduct%20Violation&body=Asset(s)%20Requested%3A%20%0A%0AProposed%20Use%3A%20%0A">report@jamesgober.dev</a> ]
</p>
<b>Please include:</b>
<ul>
    <li>A short description of the issue.</li>
    <li>Where it occurred (issue link, comment, etc.).</li>
    <li>Optional: screenshots or supporting info.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Reports will be handled discreetly and seriously.
</p>


<br>
<h2>5. Consequences &amp; Enforcement:</h2>
<b>Violation of this Code may result in:</b>
<ul>
    <li>A warning (once, maybe).</li>
    <li>Muted or locked threads.</li>
    <li>Removal from discussions.</li>
    <li>Banned from the repo or organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Maintainers have final say. This isn’t a democracy — it’s a development environment.
</p>
