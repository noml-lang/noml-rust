    <h1 align="center">CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>
    <p>
        Community guidelines for respectful collaboration.
    </p>
</div>

<br>
<h3>📌 TL;DR</h3>
<p>
    Be useful, not useless. This is a professional project, not a daycare. If you're a troll, a bully, or a self-victimizing drama magnet, you're not welcome. Keep your politics, kinks, and personal crusades out of the codebase.
</p>


<br>

<h2>1. Purpose:</h2>
<p>
    This Code of Conduct exists to keep the project clean, productive, and focused on code — not chaos.
</p>
<b>
    We don’t care who you are, what you believe, or how you identify. We care that:
</b>
<ul>
    <li>You write solid code.</li>
    <li>You collaborate without being a dick.</li>
    <li>You don’t derail the project with drama, flamewars, or personal baggage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You don't have to agree with everyone here. You just have to <b>respect the boundaries of this space.</b>
</p>

<br>
<h2>2. Expectations:</h2>
<b>
    All contributors, maintainers, users, and observers are expected to:
</b>
<ul>
    <li>Act professionally — even when joking around.</li>
    <li>Keep personal issues, politics, and crusades <b>out</b> of project discussions.</li>
    <li>Offer feedback constructively. “<i>This sucks</i>” isn’t helpful. “<i>Here’s why this might be better</i>” is.</li>
    <li>Respect project maintainers’ decisions — even if you don’t agree.</li>
    <li>Accept that dark humor, sarcasm, or bluntness <b>may exist</b>, but <b>harassment will not be tolerated</b>.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>3. Absolutely Not Tolerated:</h2>
<b>We have a zero-tolerance policy for:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Targeted harassment, stalking, or doxxing.</i>
    <li>Trolling, flamebait, or instigating fights in issues/PRs.</li>
    <li>Spam, self-promotion, or attention-seeking nonsense.</li>
    <li>Personal threats, legal threats, or hostile takeovers.</li>
    <li>Sexualized content, weird kinks, or political manifestos.</li>
    <li>Weaponized victimhood — don’t bait or cry bully for attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you're more focused on “<i>being offended</i>” than “<i>building something</i>,” you’re in the wrong place. 
</p>


<br>
<h2>4. Pronouns, Identity, and the Line:</h2>
<b>We have a zero-tolerance policy for:</b>
<ul>
    <li>
    </li>
</ul>
## 4. Pronouns, Identity, and the Line

We don’t enforce pronoun policies or ideological compliance.

But here’s the rule:
**You don’t get to harass someone for who they are, and they don’t get to derail the project over identity drama.**

* You can ignore someone’s lifestyle or views.
* You can’t **attack, humiliate, or pick fights** over them — either direction.

We're not here to “affirm” or “reject” anyone — we’re here to write code. The minute it becomes about **anything else**, you're out.

<br>
<h2>5. Consequences:</h2>
<b>Violation of this Code may result in:</b>
<ul>
    <li>A warning (once, maybe).</li>
    <li>Muted or locked threads.</li>
    <li>Removal from discussions.</li>
    <li>Banned from the repo or organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Maintainers have final say. This isn’t a democracy — it’s a development environment.
</p>

<br>
<h2>6. Final Word:</h2>
<b>We believe in:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Strong minds, not soft shells.</li>
    <li>Useful feedback, not virtue signaling.</li>
    <li>Building something real, not wasting time on internet soapboxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If that sounds good to you — welcome aboard.
    <br>
    &mdash; If not — there are plenty of other projects that cater to whatever the hell you’re looking for.
